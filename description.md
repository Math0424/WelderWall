[h1] WelderWall [/h1]

Welder wall is a replacement to-- walls of welders

Featuring customizable settings for speed, power, and size it allows admins to allow server friendly welder walls.

Far faster and more efficient than vanilla welder walls, it allows for cusomization of how much CPU it can take up




The mod is still WIP as one of the blocks are still missing a model, this will be resolved soon.
